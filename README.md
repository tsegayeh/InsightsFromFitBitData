## Insights From FitBit Data to Inform Bellabeat Marketing Strategy
 (Capstone project for Google Data Analytics Certificate Program)
 
**_Business Question._** Bellabeat, a small, successful high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, would like to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Data from FitBit were, therefore, analyzed and insights gained were used as a basis to make recommendations for Bellabeat marketing strategy. <br />
**_Preparing the data._** A set of 18 tables of FitBit’s Fitness Tracker Data, in “.csv” format, was downloaded from Kaggle website, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit. <br />
**_Processing the data._** The data were explored using the Excel, RStudio and Tableau software. Upon storing the data in Excel Workbook, each table was read into R and Tableau for exploring and cleaning purposes. Installing the different R packages and libraries, each data frame was studied. The following were observed:
  * Variables: Ten variables that are directly related to fitness activities were identifiable in the dataset, namely Steps, Distance, Intensity, Calories, METs, Heart Rate, Sleep (state, duration, frequency), Weight, Fat, and BMI.
  * Period covered: generally, the dataset covers a 31-day period, from April 12 to May 12, 2016.
Users: overall, there are 33 users of fitness tracking devices in the dataset. However, the number of users varies across activities. No description of the FitBit device users, such as sex and age, is provided.
  * Data type: Id columns in all the tables were in an integer format while the date columns in all the tables were in string format. Id was, therefore, changed to string format while date was changed to ‘date’ or ‘datetime’. To facilitate aggregation the minute-level and second-level data into hourly and daily levels, the date column was split into Date, AM/PM, Hour, and Minute columns.
  * Redundancy: Three of the tables, namely the Daily Calories, Daily intensities and Daily Steps were duplicates of the respective columns in the Daily Activities table. Therefore, these 3 tables were maintained instead of the said table.
  * Data Integrity: The sum of hourly and minutely amounts of Calories, Intensity, and Steps did not add up to the daily amounts. In that case, the minute-level data were aggregated to hourly or daily levels. <br />

When necessary, the data were also aggregated by User, grouping the data by Id, to see patterns across the 33 users; by Date, grouping the data by Date, to see patterns across the 31 days; and by Hour, grouping the data by Hour of the day to see patterns across a 24-hour day.
For categorical variables that are not quantitative, e.g., state of sleep, the category values were cross tabulated with the Id or Date variables and the frequency were used for analysis. <br />

**_Analysis of the data._** The data were analyzed using the R and Tableau software. Seven variables were involved in the analysis, namely Steps, Distance, Intensity, Heart Rate, Sleep, Calories and Weight. A summary of the findings is presented in the following section.  <br />

#### Summary Findings
**_Patterns Across Users:_** _a) Attendance._ To see the patterns of fitness activities of the tracking device users, the dates of each activity (y-axis) are mapped against the user’s ID (x-axis) to create a Gantt chart. The dates ranged from April 12, 2016 to May 12, 2016 (bottom-up on y-axis). The following chart is a graphic representation of which day the user performed an activity on. The white, blank spots represent the days on which activity was not performed or recorded. See the chart on Tableau Public at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/Summary_Patterns/DatesvsUsers. 
<br />
As it can be noticed, the bottom five variables in the chart (Distance, Intensity, Calories, Steps, METs) have the same pattern with most days performed. More accurately, the number of days on which the users performed the fitness activity were tallied as follows:
<br /><br />

For the other three variables at the top of the chart (Heart rate, Sleep, Weight), the number of users dropped from 33 to 24 for Heart Rate, to 14 for Sleep, and to 8 for Weight. Yet, the performance or record of the activities for these users was mostly intermittent. <br /> <br />
**_b) Measures vs. Attendance (Dates) Across Users._** Average values of the variables – Distance, Density, Intensity, Steps, Calories and METs – were plotted against the dates of activities for each user (see below). The peaks of the graph are associated with users who performed the activity on all or most of the days. However, this hasn’t always been true. For example, User ‘1927…. ’ with a 31-day performance scored the least value in terms of activity measures, whereas, user ‘4057…. ’  with only a four-day performance scored much higher than User ‘1927…. ’. Therefore, no consistent pattern of fitness activities measures was observed across the users. See chart at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/Summary_x/UserlyPattern. <br />

**_Patterns Across Days._** When the average values of each variable were plotted against the dates, a pattern was observed in that the highest values were recorded on April 30 for most variables, while the lowest values were recorded on May 12. Although it is not clear why the values were the highest on April 30, it is noticed that on May 12, a number of users have not performed the activities and their data might not have been included since it is a cut-off date. See chart  at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/Summary_x/DailyPattern. <br />

**_Patterns Across Hours of a Day._** A distinct pattern occurred when the average hourly data for Steps, Intensity, Calories and METs were plotted against the 24 hours of a day. Typically, fitness activities start peaking up around 4 a.m. in the morning and keep rising until it forms a peak between 12 a.m. and 2 p.m. Then occurs a significant dip at 3 p.m. until it rises again and forms a second peak between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. Finally, it sharply declines until it tappers off at 3 a.m. See chart at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/Summary_x/HourlyPatterns. <br />

**Correlation Between Variables.** Correlation was sought among the 5 of the variables - Steps, Distance, Intensity, Calories, and METs - excluding those variables with 24 or less users. Any pair of the variables has a positive correlation, with a correlation coefficient value of 0.6 or greater. Intensity, Distance and Steps each have a correlation coefficient of 0.6 with Calories while Distance and Steps have the strongest correlation, a correlation coefficient of 1. See chart on Tableau at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/6_IntensityByDate/27_Corr-33users. For correlation among all the seven variables, including heart rate and sleep, see a Tableau chart at: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/tsegaye2291/viz/6_IntensityByDate/27_corr-14users
### Insights and Recommendations
(1) Analysis of the data indicated that the overall device usage by the users was intermittent and mostly incomplete. That may mean, either the fitness devices were unable to track and capture the full amount of data (all activities/variables, all days, all users). Or else, the users have not been fully performing.<br />
**_Recommendation:_** Enhance Bellabeat App.  Bellabeat may increase user engagement in fitness activities. It takes a two-pronged strategy to achieve this. On the one hand, it would be necessary to make sure that all its tracking devices as well as the Bellabeat App are tracking and capturing the full data for all fitness activities. Reviewing its user data would be a good starting point. <br />
On the other hand, Bellabeat may need to be more aggressive in reaching out to its users by improving its communication and feedback system, including: 
  * _Alerts_ – to remind users, e.g., starting times of fitness activities <br />
  * _Notification_ – to notify performance status, e.g., attended or missed fitness activity <br />
  * _Feedback_ – to provide information on both performance and results of fitness activities, e.g., graphically – in a form of dashboard
 
(2) The relationship between attendance and results has not been consistent across users. That is, users who regularly carried out a fitness activity did not always have a higher result for a given activity, and vice versa. For example, a user with only 4 days of activities had a result higher than some who performed the activity every single day for the whole 31-day period. This indicates that the rate of progress towards a fitness goal depends on the individual user.<br />
**_Recommendation:_** Strengthen Bellabeat Membership. Usage data shows that the need for support is so variable among the users. Bellabeat, therefore, can strengthen its current membership service by adding member services that are customized to individual members. This could range from ordinary customer support service to an at-home gym with a Hi-Tech Mirror.<br /><br />
(3) The typical two-hump graph of hourly activities indicated that there are two peak periods of activities on a typical day, the first one from 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. and the second from 5 p.m. – 7 p.m. with a characteristic dip at 3 p.m.<br />
**_Recommendation:_** Bellabeat can target these two critical periods of fitness activity, i.e., 10 a.m. – 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. 7 p.m., for promotional and customer service purposes.
