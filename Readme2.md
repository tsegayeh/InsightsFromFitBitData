Among the 18 original tables, _seven_ tables were selected for analysis and these were cleaned and processed, as a result of which _Twenty_ more tables were created. The list of original and created datasets is shown <b> [here](https://github.com/tsegayeh/InsightsFromFitBitData/blob/main/DataProcessing.PNG)</b>.
